%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
As $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, we know that $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = 0$, as they can't both occur. To be
independent, we have $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$, so this means that one of $P(A)$ or $P(B)$ must
be zero, but we know they're not. Thus, they must be dependent.
