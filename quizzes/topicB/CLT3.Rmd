Question
========

The distribution of the sample proportion becomes approximately
normal if the sample  size is large enough. This is due to which
theorem?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(mchoice2text(solutions, markup="markdown"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
