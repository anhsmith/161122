Question
========

The seeds of a certain variety of peas can be classified into four distinct groups based on their appearance. These are round and yellow (RY), round and green (RG), angular and yellow (AY) and angular and green (AG). The table below shows the probability function for a given pea belonging to one of these four groups.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
peas <- data.frame(`Pea Type` = "P(Pea Type)", RY, RG, AY = '?', AG, check.names=FALSE)
peas %>%
  knitr::kable(format='html', booktabs=TRUE, align='lrrrr') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

The probability of a pea being classified as angular and yellow is closest to:

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(mchoice2text(solutions, markup="markdown"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
