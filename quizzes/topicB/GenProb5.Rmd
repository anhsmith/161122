Question
========

Suppose that events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint with $P(A) \ne 0$,and $P(B) \ne 0$, then

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========

As $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, we know that $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = 0$, as they can't both occur. To be
independent, we have $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0$, so this means that one of $P(A)$ or $P(B)$ must
be zero, but we know they're not. Thus, they must be dependent.

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(mchoice2text(solutions, markup="markdown"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
