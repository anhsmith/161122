Question
========

Which of the following is not a control chart for an attribute?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========

Attributes control charts are for nonconformities or defects being counted. Only the distribution assumed changes among the four options ($p$, $np$, $c$, $u$) here. The $\bar{x}$ chart is a variables control chart which is used for continuous type measurements.

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(mchoice2text(solutions, markup="markdown"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
