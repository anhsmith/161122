# Time Series

---


## What do we see over time?

--

Data obtained from observations collected sequentially over time are extremely common.

--

In business, we observe weekly interest rates, daily closing stock prices, monthly price indices, yearly sales figures, and so forth. 

--

In meteorology, we observe daily high and low temperatures, annual precipitation and drought indices, and hourly wind speeds. 

--

In agriculture, we record annual figures for crop and livestock production, soil erosion, and export sales. 

--

In the biological sciences, we observe the electrical activity of the heart at millisecond intervals. 

--

In ecology, we record the abundance of an animal species.

---


## Why do we study this? 

--

The list of areas in which time series are studied is virtually endless. 

--

The purpose of time series analysis is generally twofold: 

--

- to understand or model the stochastic mechanism that gives rise to an observed series and
    
- to predict or forecast the future values of a series based on the history of that series and, possibly, other related series or factors.

--
    
These are generally the same goals as for linear models - inference and prediction.

---


## Fundamental concepts

--

A **time series** is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order observed at successive equally spaced points in time. 

--

A **time series**  can be written as $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_T$ which is an ordered sequence of random variables.

--

The observations are made at times $t = 1,2,\ldots,T$.

--

A somewhat unique feature of time series and their models is that we usually cannot assume that the observations arise independently from a common population. 

--

Time series models incorporate various types of dependence among samples.

# Components of time series

---

## Components of time series

--

A time series may contain one or more of the following four components: 

  - trend, 
  - seasonal, 
  - cyclical, and 
  - irregular (unobserved or remainder)

--

These components, explained over the next few slides, describe how a time series behaves over time $t$.

--

The text book "Statistics for Business and Economics" by Prem S. Mann (1995), published by John Wiley,  gives a gentle introduction to the various components of a time series.

# Trend component

---

## Trend component

--

'Trend' is defined as the long-term movement (increase or decrease) in a time series. 
 
--

In other words, a trend is an increase or decrease in the values of a variable occurring over a
period of several years gives a trend.

--

If the values of a time series do not change on average over time, then that time series has no trend.
 
--

A trend shows the long-run pattern in the growth or decline in a time series that may represent a variable such as sales, inventories, revenues, profits, employment, population, housing starts, gross national product, consumer expenditure, investment, interest rates, etc.

---

## Trend

The long-term movement in a time series may occur due to many factors such as 

  -   changes in tastes and preferences of consumers, 
  
  -   technological changes, 
  
  -   demographic changes (changes in population and structure of population), 

  -   social and cultural changes
  
  -   etc.

---

## Trend

--

Analysis of trends in historical data helps evaluate past policies.

--

For example, the trend patterns of variables such as sales, revenues, and profits of a company for the past decade can tell us how successful the managerial policies of this period have been.

--

Knowing the trend of a time series is useful for making decisions about the future values of business and economic activities. 

--

An important question is how to extract the trend component from a time series.

- We can fit linear models with `lm()` to extract various trends from time series.
    
- We can fit more flexible 'smoother' lines using `geom_smooth()`.

# Seasonal component

---

## Seasonal component 

--

Seasonal variations in a time series are defined as the movement that occurs in a time series periodically within a fixed time period. 

--

Many business activities, such as production and sales, exhibit seasonal patterns over different time periods (e.g. months or quarters) of a year. 

--

These seasonal variations may occur due to weather, holidays, or institutional factors. For example:

  - Sales of ski equipment are very high during winter and almost nonexistent during other seasons.
  - Sales at department stores around Christmas holidays are much higher than during other times of the year.
  - Power bills are expected to be higher during winter than in other seasons.

---

## Seasonal component 

--

Such fluctuations occur every year, although they can vary in magnitude. 

--

Nevertheless, with good data and appropriate statistical analysis, many seasonal variations in business and economic activities can be predicted.

--

An important question is how to extract the seasonal component from a time series.

  - We can use linear models with factors to extract seasonality from time series
    
  - Need to address trends and seasonality together!
    
  - The variability of seasonality may increase over time. This can be modelled by taking the log of $y$.

# Irregularity

---

## Irregular component

--

Irregular fluctuations are random or chance variations in a time series. 

--

They are the residuals after trend, *cyclical*, and seasonal components have been removed from the time series data.

--

Such movements may occur due to unpredictable events such as strikes, wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, etc. 

--

These events can significantly affect the production of goods and services and other economic and business activities.

--

For example, floods usually cause a reduction in agricultural and industrial production. 

---

## Irregularity or residuals?

--

Due to the nature of irregular variations, they are impossible to predict.

--

They are similar to residuals after removing trend and seasonality from the time series regression!

--

However, we have observed that the residuals in time series regression look peculiar. 

--

They are not independent! 

--

Something evil lurks in the irregular component.

# Cycle

---


## Cyclical component

--

Usually a time series exhibits fluctuations around the trend line. 

--

That is, for some periods the actual time series curve is above the trend line and for other periods it is below the trend line. 

--

The non-periodic fluctuations in time series data around the trend line are referred to as the cyclical component or cyclical fluctuations. 

--

Note that the cyclical fluctuations do not last for any specific amount of time. They may last from more than one year to a period of 20 years.

--

Recession, depression, recovery and boom cause variations in time series
data, and these variations make up business cycles. 

--

These business cycles fluctuations are called the cyclical component or fluctuations.

---

## Cyclicity versus seasonality

--

A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors
(e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). 

  - Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period no larger than one year.

--

A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period. 

  - The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years.

--

The two are very different: 

  - If the fluctuations are not of fixed period then they are cyclic; 
    
  - if the period is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar, then the pattern is seasonal.

---

## What can I do with the cyclic component?

--

This can be the component that has the most to offer in terms of understanding where the series may be headed in the short/medium term.

--

The length and amplitude of previous cycles may forecast the next turning point in the current cycle.

--

"**20/20 hindsight**" can often explain cyclic movements around the trend line in terms of past events or other variables

--

By looking at those variables or events in the present, we may be able to predict the likely future direction of the cycle movement.

--

**The Theory of Mean Reversion.**

---

## Business cycles

--

There are a variety of economic indicators, such as interest rates, unemployment rates, migration rates, etc.

--

It is possible that some of these, or an index summarising them, may be useful in predicting the cycle factor in a time series.

--

This could be done in regression analysis with the cycle factor (an estimate of the position in the cycle) as a dependent variable. 

--

Forecasting would involve predicting the rest of the cycle (not sure we're making progress here ...) using the index as the independent variable in a regression model.

--

In this course, we won't emphasize the cyclical component as we may lump it together with the residuals.

---

## Cycle of NZ housing?

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(10,5), out.width="100%", message=FALSE}
housing.ts <- housing %>% mutate(time=1:n())
hpi.qm <- lm(total_value_of_housing_stock ~ time+I(time^2), data=housing.ts)

gh1 +
  geom_smooth(data = augment(hpi.qm, housing.ts),
              method='lm', formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), col=4) +
  # geom_smooth(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) + 
  geom_point(data = augment(hpi.qm, housing.ts),
            aes(y=.resid), col=6, size=1.2) +
  geom_line(data = augment(hpi.qm, housing.ts),
            aes(y=.resid), col=6, lwd=1) +
  annotate(geom="text", x = housing$date[7], y = 270000, label="Quadratic fit", col=4) +
  annotate(geom="text", x = housing$date[70], y = 220000, label="Residuals", col=6) +
  xlab('Time') + ylab('Total Value of Housing Stock') 
```



---

## Assemble or decompose? 

--

The components can be integrated via addition:     
$Y_t=\mbox{Trend}_t+\mbox{Cycle}_t+\mbox{Seasonality}_t+\mbox{Irregularity}_t$

--

The components can also be integrated via multiplication:     
$Y_t=\mbox{Trend}_t\times\mbox{Cycle}_t\times\mbox{Seasonality}_t\times\mbox{Irregularity}_t$

--

The above two are equivalent by log-transforming $y$.

--

Linear models are just one way to do time series decomposition. 

--

More will be covered in future statistics papers.
