Today we'll use a new dataset based on a subset of the NZTA fleet data. You can grab the whole lot (all 1.1GB of it) here if you're interested:

https://nzta.govt.nz/resources/new-zealand-motor-vehicle-register-statistics/new-zealand-vehicle-fleet-open-data-sets/#data

We'll be looking at a smaller subset of this and using it to, among other things, find the Wairarapa Member of Parliament's old ute (he's since sold it).

Start by downloading `labA08.Rmd` and load it into RStudio.

https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/161122/labs/labA08.Rmd

We're going to be looking at three things with these data:

1. Reproducing the below plot on how colours come in and out of fashion

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
fleet <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/fleet.csv.gz")
fleet |> filter(VEHICLE_TYPE == "PASSENGER CAR/VAN") |>
  group_by(VEHICLE_YEAR) |>
  count(col = BASIC_COLOUR) |>
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=VEHICLE_YEAR, y=percent)) +
  facet_wrap(~col) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Percentage of cars and vans",
       title = "The rise of orange and demise of brown and gold",
       subtitle = "Car and van colours in New Zealand") +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Whether Ford Rangers are really a rural vehicle.

3. Finding the MP for Wairarapa's Ute.

**Read through the `labA08.Rmd` file and work on the exercises within.**
